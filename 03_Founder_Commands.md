# Founder Onboarding – Strategic Identity

1. What is the internal name or codename of this project?
2. Is this project being launched for internal use or public release?
3. What core product, tool, or transformation does this venture deliver?
4. Is a domain name already owned, or should one be purchased and secured?
5. What is the earliest decision that needs to be made?

Once these are answered, the CSO will begin the first strategic model.
